# Veggie & Salad Stock Management System

## Overview

This project is a `stock management system` designed for a salad and veggie vendor. It includes functionality to manage products, their stock statuses, and dependencies between ingredients and salads. A mock database with delayed responses simulates a real-time environment.

This project was completed as a home assignment in **8 hours**.
